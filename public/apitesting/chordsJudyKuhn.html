	[VERSE]

     C                                Am
You think you own what ever land you land on
     C                                 Em
the earth is just a dead thing you can claim
    Am                              F
but I know every rock and tree and creature
      Dm            G           Am
has a life, has a spirt, has a name
    C                             Am 
you think the only people who are people
        C                              Em
are the people who look and think like you
    Am                                F
but if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
               Dm               G          C
you'll learn things you never knew never knew 


[CHORUS]

         Am                              Em        F
have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
   Am                               Em
or ask the grinning bobcat why he grins
         F                 G             Am
can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
         F                                G
can you paint with all the colors of the wind 
         F                  G             C
can you paint with all the colors of the wind


[VERSE]

     C                                Am
come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
     C                                 Em
come taste the sun sweet berries of the earth
    Am                              F
Come Roll in all the riches all around you 
      Dm            G           Am
and for once never wonder what they're worth
     C                                Am
the rain storm and the river are my brothers 
     C                                 Em
the herron and the otter are my friends
    Am                              F
and we are all connected to each other 
      Dm            G           Am
in a circle in a hoop that never ends 


[BRIDGE]

C    F            Em        Am
how high does the Sickamore grow?
       Dm                       G
if you cut it down then you'll never know


[CHORUS]

         Am                              Em        F
you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
   Am                               Em
or wheather we are white or copper skin
         F                 G             Am
you need to sing with all the voices of the mountain 
         F                                G
you need to paint with all the colors of the wind 
         Am                              Em 
you can own the earth and still all you own is earth until 
         F                  G             C
you can paint with all the colors of the wind
