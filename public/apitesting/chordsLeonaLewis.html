i hope my chords is Ok.. he3.. tnx.. Enjoy


G
Closed off from love, I didn’t need the pain
Em
Once or twice was enough, and it was all in vain
C                                             D
Time starts to pass, before you know it you’re frozen

G
But something happened for the very first time with you
Em
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
C                                               D
And everyone’s looking round, thinking I’m going crazy

CHORUS:
G
But I don’t care what they say, I’m in love with you
Em
They try to pull me away, but they don’t know the truth
C                                                  D
My heart’s crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
D
You cut me open and I,
G
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Em
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
C                                   D
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
D
You cut me open

G
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Em
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
C                                               D
Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling

G
But nothing’s greater than the rush that comes with your embrace                         
              Em
And in this world of loneliness I see your face
C                                            D
Yet everyone around me thinks that I’m going crazy, maybe, maybe

CHORUS:
G
But I don’t care what they say, I’m in love with you
Em
They try to pull me away, but they don’t know the truth
C                                                 D
My heart’s crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
D
You cut me open and I,
G
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Em
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
C                                  D
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
D
You cut me open

Em                       C
And it’s draining all of me
C                         Am
Oh they find it hard to believe
Am                              D
I’ll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

CHORUS:
G
But I don’t care what they say, I’m in love with you
Em
They try to pull me away, but they don’t know the truth
C
My heart’s crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
D
You cut me open and I,
G
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Em
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
C                                 D
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
D
You cut me open and I

G
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Em
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
C
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
D
You cut me open and I
G               D                 G
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
