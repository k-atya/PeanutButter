Intro: [Em  Cadd9   D]x2

[Verse 1]

G           D/F#     Em                        D/F#         
 I will not make the same mistakes that you did,
G         D/F#         Em                           D/F#
 I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery.
G          D/F#       Em                           D/F #
 I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard,
G                D/F#          Em                   D
 I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far...

 [Chorus]

            Em             Cadd9                D
 Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
            Em                           Cadd9            D       B7
 Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt,
            Cadd9                  G              D               B7
 Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
            Cadd9       D
 Because of you, I am afraid...

[Verse 2]
G         D/F#          Em                      D/F#       G
 I lose my way, and its not too long before you point it out,
G        D/F#   Em                             D/F#       G
 I cannot cry, because you know that's weakness in your eyes;
G             D/F#     Em                   D/F#       G 
 I'm forced to fake, a smile, a laugh, everyday of my life.
G              D/F#                      Em                   D
 My heart can't possibly break, when it wasn't even whole to start with...

[Chorus]

         Em             Cadd9                  D
 Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
            Em                           Cadd9          D
 because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt,
            Cadd9                  G                 D            B7
 because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
            Cadd9       D
 Because of you, I am afraid...

  [Bridge] 
               Bm               Em                  D
 I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep...
          Bm                      Em                  D
 I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me.
            Bm                Em                 D
 You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain,
           Bm                       Em             D
 and now I cry in the middle of the night, for the same damn thing...

**EITHER A CAPELLA OR ONE STRUM PER CHORD**
   
         Em             Cadd9                  D
 Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
            Em                           Cadd9          D
 because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt


[Chorus]

            F#m                  Dadd9            E
 Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything,
            F#m                      Dadd9       E
 becasue of you I don't know how to let anyone else in.
            Dadd9                  A               E     C#7
 Because of you I'm ashamed of my life because its empty
            Dadd9        E
 because of you, I am, afraid...

*Strum once per chord*
            F#m    Dadd9   E
 Because of you....
               F#m    Dadd9    E
...because of you......
